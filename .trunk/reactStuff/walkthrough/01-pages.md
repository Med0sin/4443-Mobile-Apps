I'm building a react.js app with multiple pages as components. There's a loading screen that has a rotating logo.gif.  Then a main page with the same logo but static, and links to a registration and login page. The final page will be a search page that will allow someone to search a mongo collection via  a set of form elements. 


If I am building a `react.js` app, and want to organize my app into different components: loading screen, registration screen, login screen, etc.. I've seen implementations where each page component is in a single file, but I would like to place each component in its own file. Can you help me create and organize a project that has the components that I've listed previously but has a structure where each component is in its own file and has a main app file that loads components as needed?


How can I use tailwind for styling my app?

Ok now I would like to add a form to my registration screen which when submitted will post the form data to this route: `http::kidsinvans.fun/register`. In the form I would like the form fields for `first_name` , `last_name`, `email`, `password` and also use tailwind css for styling.
