Setting up Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for Godot mobile app development involves a few key steps to ensure a smooth integration and workflow. Here's a streamlined guide based on the information gathered:

1. **Godot Tools Extension**: The first step is to install the Godot Tools extension for VSCode, which provides game development tools for working with the Godot Engine. This extension supports all features for Godot 4, including GDScript language features (syntax highlighting, code navigation, and autocompletions), a GDScript debugger, and language features for GDResource and GDShader. You can install this extension from the Visual Studio Marketplace for automatic updates or from GitHub for stable releases without automatic updates【12†source】.

2. **Configuring Godot to Use VSCode**: In Godot, go to Editor > Editor Settings and navigate to Text Editor > External. You'll need to:
   - Check the "Use External Editor" option.
   - Set the "Exec Path" to the path of your VSCode executable. On macOS, it's typically at `/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron`.
   - Use specific "Exec Flags" to properly start VSCode with Godot: `{project} --goto {file}:{line}:{col}`【12†source】.

3. **Setting Up Language Server in Godot**: Ensure the Language Server settings are correct for seamless communication between Godot and VSCode. The default settings usually work fine, but make sure the "Remote Port" is set correctly (typically 6005) and "Enable Smart Resolve" and "Show Native Symbols in Editor" are turned on for enhanced IntelliSense support【13†source】.

4. **Configuring VSCode**: In VSCode, ensure your settings align with those in Godot, particularly the language server port (`Gdscript_lsp_server_port` should match Godot's setting). Install necessary extensions like C# Tools for Godot (if using C#) and Godot files for improved file path resolution【13†source】.

5. **Debugging Setup**: For debugging, create a `launch.json` file in VSCode under the Run and Debug section. You can start with a minimal configuration and adjust it according to your project's needs. The configuration allows you to launch and debug your Godot projects directly from VSCode【13†source】.

With these configurations, pressing F5 in VSCode should start Godot, allowing you to run and debug your game directly from the editor. Remember, Godot needs to be open for the language server to run, which is essential for IntelliSense functionality【13†source】.

For detailed instructions and the latest updates, it's always a good idea to refer to the official [Godot documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org) and the [Godot Tools GitHub page](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-vscode-plugin).
